#I want to help
Currently there is no documentation for the project, but you can always help by doing something from the original game or the issues list and I'll see what to do with it.

#I want to play
You can either download the repository and build the game on your own or get a possibly deprecated binary from [link to appear here]. You might have to change the Photon GUID.
